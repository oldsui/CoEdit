#Real-time collaborative editor similar to Google Doc 


Updated: 

Added support of UNDO/REDO.
but only for windows: Ctrl + Z/Y: UNDO/REDO

TODOs:

1. Database for different docs. Currently only one doc and the doc number is meaningless.

2. Map all the keys. E.g. 'shift' is not supported yet. However, it's only some tedious mapping work.

3. Selection transform, copy, paste, etc.
